This guy is beyond creepy, and it looks like he's been stalking Emily for a while. That love letter... I can't believe someone would actually write something like that.\nWe need to dig deeper. Can you find out more about who this guy is and what he's planning? There has to be more to this. Emily's in danger, and we need to stop this before it gets worse.\nThanks for all your help, man. I really appreciate it.\n- Jason","text": "WTF!!!","date": "06/16/2024"}],
