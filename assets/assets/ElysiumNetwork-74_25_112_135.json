During this time, you might notice that some of the shared files and tools you use will be temporarily unavailable. Please try to get any important work done before this time so it doesn’t get interrupted.\nAlso, just as a quick reminder—if you need to access any of the local servers during this time, you can still log in as usual. For example, if you use the 'EServer' login to manage security, everything will work the same because the system uses the same IP address on our network, so nothing special needs to be set up.\nIf you run into any problems, feel free to contact the IT team before Thursday.\nThanks for your understanding!\n P.S the Hidden folder is back up.\nBest,\nIT Guy\nIT Department",
